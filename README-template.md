# 🎫 Coding Conf 2025 - Ticket Generator

This is a solution to the [Conference ticket generator challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w). This project helped me enhance form validation, styling with Tailwind CSS, and overall UI/UX experience.

### 🛠 Built With

- Semantic **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Vanilla file validation logic

### 🤓 What I Learned

- How to handle custom file uploads using a hidden file input
- Tailwind tricks for background images and layering
- Styling inputs and states like hover, focus, and disabled
- Writing accessible forms with proper `label` usage

```js
// Simple validation snippet I used
if (!email.includes('@')) {
  alert('Please enter a valid email address');
}
```

### 🔁 Continued Development

In future versions, I'd like to:

- Add preview for uploaded avatar
- Generate downloadable ticket using Canvas or HTML2Canvas
- Add form animation on submit
- Store submitted entries in localStorage or Firebase
